\section{A theorem for attractor of endomorphism on k-affinoid spaces}

In this section, we copy \cite[Appendix A]{Xie25ZDOsurfaces}.

Fix an algebraically closed non-Archimedean complete field \(\kkk\) of characteristic zero, typically \(\kkk = \bbC_p\).

Let \(A\) be a strictly and reduced \(\kkk\)-affinoid algebra, and \(X = \scrM(A)\) be its Berkovich spectrum.
Let \(f: X \to X\) be a finite morphism of Berkovich spaces over \(\kkk\). 


\begin{definition}
    Let \(\rho_A\) be the spectral seminorm on \(A\). 
    For any \(g \in A\), we define
    \[ \rho_f(g) \coloneqq \lim_{n \to \infty} \rho_A\left( (f^*)^n(g) \right) \]
    where \(f^*: A \to A\) is the induced endomorphism on \(A\).
    Denote by
    \[ \calN_f \coloneqq \{ g \in A \mid \rho_f(g) = 0 \}. \]
\end{definition}
    

The main result is the following theorem.

\begin{theorem}[{ref. \cite[Theorem 8.3]{Xie25ZDOsurfaces}}]\label{thm:attractor_is_Zariski_closed_and_endomorphism_descends}
    
\end{theorem}
