\section{A theorem for attractor of endomorphism on k-affinoid spaces}

    In this section, we copy \cite[Appendix A]{Xie25ZDOsurfaces}.

    Fix an algebraically closed non-Archimedean complete field \(\kkk\) of characteristic zero, typically \(\kkk = \bbC_p\).

    Let \(A\) be a strictly and reduced \(\kkk\)-affinoid algebra, and \(X = \scrM(A)\) be its Berkovich spectrum.
    Let \(f: X \to X\) be a finite morphism of Berkovich spaces over \(\kkk\). 

    \begin{definition}\label{def:f_spectral_radius_and_quasinilpotent_ideal}
        Let \(\rho_A\) be the spectral radius on \(A\). 
        For any \(g \in A\), we define
        \[ \rho_f(g) \coloneqq \lim_{n \to \infty} \rho_A\left( (f^*)^n(g) \right) \]
        where \(f^*: A \to A\) is the induced endomorphism on \(A\).
        Denote by
        \[ \Qnil_f \coloneqq \{ g \in A \mid \rho_f(g) = 0 \}. \]
    \end{definition}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:uniformly_converge_on_quinilpotent_ideal}
        There exists a constant \(0 < c < 1\) and \(m \geq 1\) such that for any \(g \in \Qnil_f\), we have
        \[ \rho_A\left( (f^*)^{m}(g) \right) \leq c \rho_A(g). \]
    \end{proposition}

    \paragraph{Assumption} We further assume that \(X\) is distinguished.
    And there exists a subvariety \(\tilde{Z} \subseteq \tilde{X}\) such that \(\tilde{f}(\tilde{X}) = \tilde{Z}\) and \(\tilde{f}|_{\tilde{Z}}\) is an automorphism of \(\tilde{Z}\).

    Set \(Y = V(\Qnil_f) \subseteq X\) be the closed analytic subspace defined by the ideal \(\Qnil_f\).
    

    The main result is the following theorem.

    \begin{theorem}[{ref. \cite[Theorem 8.3]{Xie25ZDOsurfaces}}]\label{thm:attractor_is_Zariski_closed_and_endomorphism_descends}
        We have 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \(\widetilde{\Qnil_f} = I_{\tilde{Z}}\), the ideal of \(\tilde{Z}\) in \(\tilde{X}\);
            \item \(Y\) is distinguished, and \(f|_{Y}: Y \to Y\) is an automorphism;
            \item there exists a unique \(\psi: X \to Y\) making \(Y \injmap X\) a section of \(\psi\), 
                such that \(f|_{Y} \circ \psi = \psi \circ f\); 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{theorem}



    Let \(X = \scrM(\kkk{x,y})\) be the closed unit polydisc of dimension two over \(\kkk\).
    Suppose that \(f: X \to X\) satisfies 
    \[ \tilde{f}: (x,y) \mapsto (a x + b, 0). \]

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:local_ZDO_of_surface}

    \end{proposition}
