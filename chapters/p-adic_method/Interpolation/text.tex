\section{Interpolation}

    The main reference of this section is \cite{Poonen14interpolation}.
    We first state the main theorem of this section.

    \begin{theorem}\label{prop:Poonen14_p-adic_interpolation_of_iterates}
        Let \(\kk\) be a complete non-archimedean field of characteristic \(0\) with \(\characteristic \calk_\kk = p\) and \(|p|_\kk = 1/p\).
        Suppose that \(f\in \kk\{ \underline{T} \}^d\) satisfies \(\|f(\underline{T}) - \underline{T}\| \leq r_p\).
        Then there exists a function \(g \in \kk\{ \underline{T}, n \}\) such that for each \(n \in \bbZ_{\geq 0}\) and each \(\underline{t} \in \kk^d\),
        \[g(\underline{t}, n) = f^n(\underline{t}).\]
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{theorem}

    \Yang{If \(f\) is invertible, can we see that \(g\) is unique?}
