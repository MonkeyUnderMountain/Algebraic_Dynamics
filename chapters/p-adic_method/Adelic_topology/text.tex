\section{Adelic topology}

    The main reference of this section is \cite{Xie25ZDOsurfaces}.

    % Let \(\kk\) be a number field, and let \(M_\kk\) be the set of places of \(\kk\).

\subsection{Basic adelic subset}

    Let \(\kk\) be a finitely generated field over \(\bbQ\) and \(\kkk\) be its algebraic closure.

    % Let \(X\) be a variety over \(\kk\) with \(\kk\) a finitely generated field over \(\bbQ\).
    % Set \(M_\kk\) be the set of places of \(\kk\).
    % For each \(v\in M_\kk\).

    Let \(\calI_\kk\) be the set of all embeddings \(\sigma: \kk \to \bbC_\sigma\) over \(\kk\), where \(\bbC_\sigma = \bbC_p\) or \(\bbC\) according to whether \(v\) is non-archimedean or archimedean.
    For each \(\sigma\in \calI_\kk\), set \(\calI_\sigma = \{\tau: \kkk \to \bbC_v \mid \tau|_\kk = \sigma\}\).
    For every \(\tau \in \calI_\kkk\), we have an induced map \(\phi_\tau: X(\kkk) \to X(\bbC_\tau)\).

    On \(X(\bbC_\tau)\), we have the analytic topology induced from \(\bbC_\tau\).
    

    \begin{definition}\label{def:basic_adelic_subset}
        Let \(\sigma,\sigma_i \in \calI_\kk\) and let \(U,U_i \subseteq X(\bbC_\sigma)\) be an open subset in the analytic topology.
        We define
        \[ X_\kk(\sigma,U) := \bigcup_{\tau\in \calI_\sigma} \phi_\tau^{-1}(U) \subseteq X(\kkk) \]
        and 
        \[ X_\kk(\{\sigma_i,U_i\}_{i=1}^n) := \bigcap_{i=1}^n X_\kk(\sigma_i,U_i) \subseteq X(\kkk). \]
        The subset of form \(X_\kk(\{\sigma_i,U_i\}_{i=1}^n)\) is called a \emph{basic adelic open subset} of \(X(\kkk)\), where \(U\subseteq X(\bbC_\sigma)\) is an open subset in the analytic topology.
    \end{definition}

    \begin{theorem}[{ref. \cite[Proposition 3.9]{Xie25ZDOsurfaces} cf. \cite{}}]\label{thm:intersection_of_basic_adelic_subset_is_nonempty}
        Suppose that \(X\) is irreducible.
        Then for any finite collection of places \(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n \in M_\kk\) and any basic adelic open subsets \(X_\kk(\sigma_i,U_i)\) for \(i=1,\ldots,n\), the intersection
        \[ \bigcap_{i=1}^n X_\kk(\sigma_i,U_i) \]
        is non-empty.
    \end{theorem}
